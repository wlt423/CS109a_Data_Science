    "There is an inverse relationship between test and training R2 for the 3 regressions. The simple regression has the highest training R2. This is to be expected, as there is no penalty. However, the test R2 suffers as a result of this overfitting. The Lasso and Ridge, while having lower training R2, have much better performance on the testing data as a result of the regularization penalty. Ridge performs the best of the three for predicting on the test set for all sample sizes, Lasso only performs as well as Ridge when the sample size is large. As far as the confidence intervals, they tighten as the sample size increases. This is to be expected. Given a small sample size, we would use Ridge regression with an alpha value of 10."

    "Due to occasional system crashes, some of the bike counts reported in the data set have been recorded manually. These counts are not very unreliable and are prone to errors. It is known that roughly 5% of the labels in the training set are erroneous (i.e. can be arbitrarily different from the true counts), while all the labels in the test set were confirmed to be accurate. Unfortunately, the identities of the erroneous records in the training set are not available. Can this information about presence of 5% errors in the training set labels (without details about the specific identities of the erroneous rows) be used to improve the performance of the model in Part (g)? Note that we are interested in improving the $R^2$ performance of the model on the test set (not the training $R^2$ score). \n",

    "As a final task, we require you to come up with a strategy to fit a regression model, taking into account the errors in the training set labels. Explain the intuition behind your approach (we do not expect a detailed mathematical justification). Use your approach to fit a regression model on the training set, and compare its test $R^2$ with the model in Part (g).\n",

    "**Note:** Again, we do not require you to implement a new regression solver for handling erroneous labels. It is sufficient that you to come up with an approach that uses existing built-in functions. Your regression model may use the same polynomial terms used in Part (g)."
